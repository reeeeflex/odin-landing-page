Version 0.2 of Landing Page
------------------------------
HTML
* Added an extra box
* Added another section for the quote

CSS
* Added various styling options on the website
* Created @media and changed some elements

I was able to introduce a @media that will adjust after 768px of the web browser making it readable on a mobile device. The last thing that was done was the quote box, I'll be adding some finishing touches on that as well as creating a footer and wrapping it all together with some real images and actually creating a website.

Version 0.1 of Landing Page
------------------------------
* Created bare bones of html
* Imported Roboto font from google
* Styled some basics of the website

Was able to format the layout for the website going back and forth with "Flexbox Crash Course 2022" on youtube. I plan to use that as well as my other resources to be able to fully complete the website. The website will also have different images and be more niche once the bare-bones have been made.
