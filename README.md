# odin-landing-page

Version 0.1 of Landing Page
------------------------------
* Created bare bones of html
* Imported Roboto font from google
* Styled some basics of the website

Was able to format the layout for the website going back and forth with "Flexbox Crash Course 2022" on youtube. I plan to use that as well as my other resources to be able to fully complete the website. The website will also have different images and be more niche once the bare-bones have been made.
